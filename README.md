# NixOS Configuration
These are my personal configuration files. Currently not using flakes (as of 09/06/2024).

Heavy inspiration (and some copied snippets) from [Frost-Phoenix's](https://github.com/Frost-Phoenix/nixos-config) configuration for NixOS and Hyprland.

Hoping to iron out more "issues" as they arise but, I will not be making any adjustments or helping with installation issues if you decide to use this.

## **Current To-Do's:**
- [ ] Docker enablement and setup
- [ ] Updated GRUB splash screen
- [ ] Better wallpaper configuration on new install (possible installation script for fresh installs)
- [ ] Icon and Text size fix
- [ ] OBS Overlay setup and Version Control
- [X] Complete transition from Vim to Doom Emacs
- [X] Install and configure Doom Emacs properly
- [X] Configure Hyprpicker
- [X] Hyprland
    - [X] Animations
    - [X] Window Rules
    - [X] Window Binds
    - [X] Blur
    - [X] Reset configuration on `home-manager switch`
~~- [ ] Ranger Customization~~ Using Nautilus and Dired
~~- [ ] QMK setup~~ No need to do this as I have swapped to a ZMK based board.
