# NixOS Configuration
These are my personal configuration files. Currently not using flakes (as of 09/06/2024).

Heavy inspiration (and some copied snippets) from [Frost-Phoenix's](https://github.com/Frost-Phoenix/nixos-config) configuration for NixOS and Hyprland.

Hoping to iron out more "issues" as they arise but, I will not be making any adjustments or helping with installation issues if you decide to use this.

## **Current To-Do's:**
- [ ] Complete transition from Vim to Neovim
- [ ] Install and configure Doom Emacs properly
- [ ] Configure Hyprpicker
- [ ] Hyprland
    - [ ] Animations
    - [ ] Window Rules
    - [ ] Window Binds
    - [ ] Blur
    - [ ] Reset configuration on `home-manager switch`
- [ ] Ranger Customization
- [ ] QMK setup
