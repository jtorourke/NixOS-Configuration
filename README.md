# NixOS Configuration
These are my personal configuration files. Currently not using flakes (as of 09/06/2024).

Heavy inspiration (and some copied snippets) from [Frost-Phoenix's](https://github.com/Frost-Phoenix/nixos-config) configuration for NixOS and Hyprland.

Hoping to iron out more "issues" as they arise but, I will not be making any adjustments or helping with installation issues if you decide to use this.
